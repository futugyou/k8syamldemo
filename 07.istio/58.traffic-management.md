control configuration sharing across namespaces
```
// only requests from workloads in the same namespace can be affected by the following virtual service
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: myservice
spec:
  hosts:
  - myservice.com
  exportTo:
  - "."
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: myservice
```

destination rule lookup path
1. client namespace
2. service namespace
3. the configured meshconfig.rootNamespace namespace (istio-system by default)
Istio uses this restricted destination rule lookup path for two reasons:
1. prevent destination rules from being defined that can override the behavior of services in completely unrelated namespaces.
2. have a clear lookup order in case there is more than one destination rule for the same host.
